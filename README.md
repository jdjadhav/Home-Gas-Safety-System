METHODOLOGY 
****************************************************************************************************************
Our system works by continuously monitoring the surrounding air for gas leaks using 
an MQ-series gas sensor. The sensor is connected to an ESP32 microcontroller, 
which reads the gas concentration levels in real time. If the gas level crosses a 
predefined safety threshold, the ESP32 triggers a series of automatic actions. 
First, the system activates a buzzer to provide an immediate audio alert to people 
nearby. At the same time, it sends an emergency WhatsApp message to a predefined 
phone number using the ThingESP platform. This ensures that the user is notified 
instantly, even if they are not physically present. 
To prevent further danger, the ESP32 also controls a servo motor that automatically 
turns off the gas valve. The system is designed with a safety-first approach ‚Äî it will 
not allow the valve to open again until gas levels return to normal. 
Users can also interact with the system remotely using simple WhatsApp commands 
like "on", "off", "status", and "reset_alert". This remote control functionality allows 
users to check the status of the system and operate it safely from anywhere. 
The entire project is programmed and tested using the Arduino IDE. We used WiFi 
connectivity for seamless mobile integration, and implemented rate-limiting in the 
alert system to avoid message spamming. This makes the solution efficient, 
responsive, and user-friendly.
